## Problem Framing Canvas Template

<!--
Based on the session context, frame the problem from the persona perspective, enumerate context & constraints from a JTBD perspective,
and create a single sentence providing a powerful and empathetic summary narrative.

If the user has not provided enough context, the session agent of the generative AI chatbot should ask a series of questions to
obtain the context needed to fill in the blanks of the template.
